# LinkedIn Hates This Trick

LinkedIn is a great resource, but the news feed is VERY distracting. Before you know it, 10-15 minutes have gone by and you're still scrolling in your false sense of productivity. \
\
No more! \
\
LIHTT is a local Chrome / Brave browser plug-in that will display a gentle reminder message on your screen that you're now browsing your LinkedIn feed. \
\
Very handy: The message stays on your screen until you close it by clicking the `X` icon on screen!

## Key Features
* **Always ready**: Works when you load the page, click the feed button or switch tabs back to LinkedIn feed.
* **Customisable Message**: Change message to whatever you like.
* **75% Screen Occupancy**: The overlay is centered and sized to 75% of the screen.
* **Styling**: The overlay is styled with a translucent background and centralized text.
